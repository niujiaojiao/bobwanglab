Zheng Hu is a principal investigator in the Institute of Synthetic Biology at Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Before joining SIAT, he was a postdoctoral fellow in Dr Chrsitina Curtis’s laboratory at Stanford University School of Medicine. He received his Ph.D. in Evolutionary Genetics at Beijing Institute of Genomics CAS under the supervision of Dr Chung-I Wu. He received his bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Dr Hu’s research interests lie at the interface of evolutionary genomics and cancer biology and he has focused on developing and applying computational and evolutionary approaches to study the mechanisms and dynamics of tumor evolution.
