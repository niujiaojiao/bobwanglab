We study the evolutionary and quantitative principles underlying the clonal expansion, metastasis, drug resistance of somatic cells (cancer cells more specifically). This involves understanding both the genomic variations and the underlying evolutionary processes that govern cancer progression and characterize their response to microenvironmental variability and change. We use multi-disciplinary approaches including multi-omics data integration, evolutionary genomics, mathematical/computational models and systems biology to explore tumor-microenvironment interaction dynamics and pursue synthetic biologic approaches to steer cancer evolution.

Weâ€™re looking for people who share these interests and are looking for graduate students, postdocs, assistant investigators or research assistants to come join us!
