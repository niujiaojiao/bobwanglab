To promote the construction and application of semi-artificial photosynthetic cell factories. To construct novel semi-artificial photosynthetic systems, via modular assembly, cell surface-display, biomineralization and self-assembly (of cells and semiconducting nanomaterials); to explore their potential applications in energy, environment and biomedicine fields.
